HTML isn't a programming language. <span class="highlight-text">HTML is a markup language</span>.

<span class="highlight-text">Markup languages are languages used to describe the structure of text.</span>
Most text consists of different parts. 
For example, a news article might contain headings, subheadings, paragraphs, lists, images, and tables.
Markup languages provide standards for describing each of these parts of text.


<span class="highlight-text">Hyper Text Markup Language</span>, or HTML, is a markup language.
Specifically, <span class="highlight-text">HTML is the standard language used to describe the structure of text to be displayed in web browser.</span>

Every single website and web page uses HTML to describe its structure.
Accordingly, learning HTML is essential for every web developer.

## What Does HTML Look Like?

Below is a basic HTML document. 
Don't worry about understanding anything yet.
Instead, <span class="highlight-text">observe how the normal text is surrounded by strange looking symbols</span> such as `<p>` and `<h1>`.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>A Basic HTML Document</title>
    <meta name="description" content="An example of a basic HTML document.">
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>
      HTML is a markup language used to describe the
      structure of text to a web browser.
    </p>
  </body>
</html>
```

These "strange looking symbols" are called `tags`.
Tags are the part of HTML that tell your web browser how each individual part of a text should be displayed.
We will learn more about tags and this basic document in the [next lesson](/courses/html/basic-html-document).
